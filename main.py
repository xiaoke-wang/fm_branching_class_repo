# Names of tea company employees:
names = ['Leaf', 'Mailk', 'Cake', 'Jammy', 'Spoonah']
# Surnames of tea company employees:
surnames = ['Sugaro', 'Cuppo', 'Creamoff', 'Bru', 'Lipton']


# ========= Taks 2: Make a hotfix ===========
# Find the error in the following code and fix within branch 'hotfix'.

# Print out the names and surnames of all the five employees
# in format "Name Surname". At the moment, for some reason, they are
# printed as "NameSurname" without a space, which is wrong.
for i in range(len(names)):
    print(names[i],' ',surnames[i])



# ========= Taks 3: Implement a feature ===========
# Print all 25 combinations of employees' names and surnames.
# Commit this within branch 'feature' and then merge to 'master'

# Your code goes here:
for i in range(len(names)):
    for j in range(len(surnames)):
        print(names[i],' ',surnames[j])
